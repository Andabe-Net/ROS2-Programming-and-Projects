ROS Programming

Installation: ROS humble installed on WSL2 Ubuntu version 22.04.4, and VcXsrv Server for GUI

BUGS:

Bug1 during installation:
	Could not be able to "add the ROS2 GPG key with apt" with the following command because connection to the github repo always
	timeout. ALso could not open in my browser.
  command:
	>>> sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
	>>> sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
  solution>>: 
	used google Colab and python "requests" module to download the key from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key" 
	and saved the the key to a newly created file same name as "ros-archive-keyring.gpg",
	downloaded the file and moved to /usr/share/keyrings/ directory on my ubuntu,
	so that file is now /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg containing the key.
	
	alternative:
		Since I could access the raw github file with colab and not with my browser,
		most likely a network issue, and using a VPN worked well, as I was able to view
		the key in github.

Bug2: 
	-always source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash to load ros2 commands else get command not found error,
	-maybe a good idea to add the source command to the start up file with
	 >>> echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc	
info:	
	ROS2 works on the principle of inter-component communication

Bug3 with running turlesim: 

	GUI and opening mutilple GUI windows:
	 - unfortunaletly, WSL2 Ubuntu has no GUI. Needed to install VcXsrv,
	- setting environment variable to the ID of the VcXsrv instance with DISPLAY=:0.0,
	- I can open multiple VcXsrv windows each of different ID, then set environment variables
	  DISPLAY to corresponding ID of the monitor in each terminal instance.
	
	Remote and local Connection:
		- Could not control turtle using commands.
		- found out ROS2 communication is not limited to localhost.
		solutions>>
			- Putting off VPN I was able to solve this.
			- ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY environment variable allows you to limit ROS 2 communication to localhost only
			- do this with: 
				>>>echo "export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1" >> ~/.bashrc

	Remapping: allows you to reassign default node properties e.g node name, topic name, etc to custom values. 
		-needed a second teloeop to control turtle2
		-do with remapping the cmd_vel topic to target turtle2 with
		  >>> ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key --ros-args --remap turtle1/cmd_vel:=turtle2/cmd_vel
Bug4:
	Running rqt in its own window
	-open a new vcXsrv instance, it will have its own window ID e.g :1.0
	-set and export DISPLAY variable to the ID on the terminal to run rqt e.g >>> export DISPLAY=:1.0
	
info:Running an executable froma package:
	>>> ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
	>>>ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
info: a single executable(C++ or python program) can contain one or more nodes
	list nodes
	>>> ros2 node list
	info about nodes
	>>> ros2 node info <node_name>
	   >>> ros2 node info /my_turtle

	topics:
	list topics
	>> ros2 topic list
	>> ros2 topic list -t

	view data published over a topic
	>> ros2 topic echo <topic_name>
	>> ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
	
	vie topic info:
	>> ros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
rqt_gragh: inspection tool to view and inspect ROS gragh
	>>> rqt_graph
info on ros2 interface show: 
	Nodes send data over topics using messages. Publishers and subcribers must send and receive 
	meassages of the same type to communicate
	to view details about a particular message type
	>> ros2 interface show <message_type>
	cmcd_level of type geometry_msgs/msg/Twist(meaning module geometry_msgs has a msg called Twist)
	>> ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist

info on ros2 topic pub:

	to publish message to a topic directly, must be in YAML format
	>> ros2 topic pub <topic_name> <message_type> '<args>'
	>> ros2 topic pub --once /turtle2/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 0.0}}"
	or to deliver message at steady stream of 1Hz
	>> ros2 topic pub --rate 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}"
